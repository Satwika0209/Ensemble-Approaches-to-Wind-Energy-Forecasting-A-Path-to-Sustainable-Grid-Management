# Ensemble-Approaches-to-Wind-Energy-Forecasting-A-Path-to-Sustainable-Grid-Management
This project uses ensemble learning (Linear Regression, Random Forest, and their ensemble) to improve wind energy forecasting accuracy. It supports sustainable grid management by minimizing prediction errors using real-world data and evaluating performance through metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
